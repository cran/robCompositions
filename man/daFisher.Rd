Discriminant analysis by Fishers rule.
}
\usage{
daFisher(x, grp, coda = TRUE, method = "classical", plotScore=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a matrix or data frame containing the explanatory variables
          (training set)
}
  \item{grp}{
grouping variable: a factor specifying the class for each
          observation.
}
  \item{coda}{
TRUE, when if is a compositional data set.
}
  \item{method}{
\dQuote{classical} or \dQuote{robust}
}
  \item{plotScore}{
TRUE, if the scores should be plotted automatically.
}
}
\details{
The Fisher rule leads only to linear boundaries. However, this method allows for dimension reduction and thus
for a better visualization of the separation boundaries. For the Fisher discriminant rule (Fisher, 1938; Rao, 1948) the
assumption of normal distribution of the groups is not explicitly required, although the method looses its optimality
in case of deviations from normality.

The classical Fisher discriminant rule is invariant to ilr and clr transformations. The robust rule is invariant
to ilr transformations if affine equivariant robust estimators of location and covariance are taken.

Robustification is done (method \dQuote{robust}) by estimating the columnwise means and the covariance
by the Minimum Covariance Estimator.
